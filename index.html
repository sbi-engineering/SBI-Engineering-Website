				<h4>Our Mission</h4>
				<p>
					As cliche as it sounds, our mission is simple: Offer cost effective parts and tools made by car guys, for car guys. With our professional engineering background, we aim to design, prototype, and manufacture ways to make your car yours utilizing quality materials and processes that are designed and manufactured in the US. Whether it's an aesthetically perfect restoration build that needs that one last discontinued interior piece, or a nasty time attack monster that needs a custom aero kit, we are here to help you customize your vehicle to match that poster that's been mounted to your wall since a child.
